ðŸ§  Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
This project focuses on customer segmentation analysis using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior and identify the most valuable customers for targeted marketing.

Using RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), customers were segmented based on:

Recency â€“ How recently a customer made a purchase
Frequency â€“ How often they purchase
Monetary â€“ How much they spend

Key steps include:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
RFM feature engineering
Outlier detection and removal
K-Means clustering to group similar customers
Visualization of customer clusters
Identification of high-value or VIP customer segments

This segmentation helps businesses understand different customer groups and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
